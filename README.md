Just a beginner's clock project to practice an OOP approach to setting up an object for the GUI to have a same GuI structure constructor for when there are multiple views being made within the Same app
Inpesct the code for if you want to learn something. You could also just is it as a viable clock because it does work, though your OS has a pre-installed one already that is probably better.
