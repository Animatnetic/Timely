# Timely
Just a beginners Clock project

This was done by me to further learn how to utilize Inheritence within Object Oriented Programming to consturct multiple views that are on the same window within a modular manner.
E.g: There are the same buttons formed at the left side of the screen to navigate through the app no matter what view I am on. Instead of copying and pasting its construction, it is instead constructed upon initialization.

You can fork this project to inspect this code if you want to learn an application of OOP. You could also just download it if you wanted to, but your OS has a better clock app that is probably already pre-isntalled.

## Packages used:
1. TTK Bootstrap (A fork of tkinter with prettier GuI)
2. datetime
3. playsound
